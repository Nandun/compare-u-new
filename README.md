# compare-u
SWE 432 Project

Four scenarios:
1. Users can register and login

2. Users can see detailed information about one specific university at a time

3. Users can compare multiple universities using a radar chart implemented with D3

4. Users who are logged in can save their comparisons


For HW3 we have implemented (somewhat simplified versions of) scenarios 1 and 2.
