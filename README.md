# compare-u
SWE 432 Project

NOTE:
deployed on Heroku at compare-u.herokuapp.com

Can also be run using `node server.js`

Four scenarios:

1. Users can register and login

2. Users can see detailed information about one specific university at a time

3. Added todo-list fucntion for favorite universities

4. Users can compare multiple universities using a radar chart implemented with D3


For HW4 we have implemented (somewhat simplified versions of) scenarios 1, 2, and 3.
